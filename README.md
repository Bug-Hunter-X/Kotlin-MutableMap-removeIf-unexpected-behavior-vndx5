This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin related to the use of `removeIf` with `MutableMap`. The `removeIf` function, when applied to the entries of a mutable map, directly modifies the original map. This behavior can be unexpected if you're not aware of it. The `bug.kt` file contains code that showcases the issue, and the `bugSolution.kt` file shows how to use `filter` to create a new map without modifying the original.
